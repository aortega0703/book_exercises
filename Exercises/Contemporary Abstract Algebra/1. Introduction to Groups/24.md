If $F$ is a reflection in the dihedral group $D_n$ find all elements $X$ in $D_n$ such that $X^2$ = $F$ and all elements $X$ in $D_n$ such that $X^3 = F$.
##### Solution:
- $X^2 = F$:
	By exercise [[Exercises/Contemporary Abstract Algebra/1. Introduction to Groups/8|8]] two rotations in succession equal a rotation, same with reflections. Then there is no such $X$.
- $X^3 = F$:
	$X^3=X^2 X=F$. By exercise [[Exercises/Contemporary Abstract Algebra/1. Introduction to Groups/8|8]] $X^2$ is a rotation, then $X$ must be a reflection. Reflections are their own inverses, so $F=X^3=X^2 X= R_0 X = X$.
Then the only solution is $X=F$.
