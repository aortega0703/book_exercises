Describe the symmetries of a non-square rectangle. Construct the corresponding Cayley table. Is this group Abelian? What property does this group have in common with the dihedral groups?
##### Solution:
- Rotation $0\degree$:

| $1\backslash 2$ | $R_0$     | $R_{180}$ | $M_V$     | $M_H$     |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| $R_0$           | $R_0$     | $R_{180}$ | $M_V$     | $M_H$     |
| $R_{180}$       | $R_{180}$ | $R_0$     | $M_H$     | $M_V$     |
| $M_V$           | $M_V$     | $M_H$     | $R_0$     | $R_{180}$ |
| $M_H$           | $M_H$     | $M_V$     | $R_{180}$ | $R_0$     |
This group is Abelian. It is similar to dihedral groups in the sense that rotation and reflection concatenation behave as $1$ and $-1$ do with multiplication.
