Consider an infinitely long strip of equally spaced Hâ€™s:$$
\dots H H H H \dots$$Describe the symmetries of this strip. Is the group of symmetries of the strip Abelian?
##### Solution:
- Translation by $k$ ($T_k$):
	Maps end $c$ to $c+k$

- Rotation around $k=0.5n$ ($R_k$):
	Maps end $c$ to $-c'+2k$

- Reflection over $k=0.5n$ ($M_k$):
	Maps end $c$ to $-c + 2k$

- Reflection vertically ($V$):
	Maps end $c$ to $c'$

The group is not abelian as for example $T_2 M_0 = M_{-1} \neq M_1 = M_0 T_2$
