Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime and $r$ is any integer. Show that there are integers $x$ and $y$ such that $mx+ ny = r$.
##### Solution:
By [[Relative Primes Iff Linear Combination Equals 1]] for some $s,t\in\mathbb{Z}$$$
\begin{align}
	ms + nt &= 1\\
	m(sr) + n(tr) &= r
\end{align}
$$So $x=sr$ and $y=tr$.
