What is the largest bet that cannot be made with chips worth $\$7.00$ and $\$9.00$? Verify that your answer is correct with both forms of induction.
##### Solution:
- $47 = 7s + 9t$ has no solutions for $s,t\geq0$:
	Consider$$
	\begin{align}
		47 &\equiv 7s &(\operatorname{mod} 9)\\
		2 &\equiv 7s &(\operatorname{mod} 9)\\
		8 &\equiv s &(\operatorname{mod} 9)
	\end{align}
	$$Therefore $s = 9q + 8$ for some $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. By substituting it into the original equation yields$$
	\begin{align}
		47 &= 7(9q + 8) + 9t\\
		9t &= -63q -9\\
		t &= -7q - 1
	\end{align}
	$$By letting $s\geq 0$ then$$
	\begin{align}
		9q + 8 &\geq 0\\
		9q &\geq -8\\
		q &\geq 0
	\end{align}
	$$On the other hand, by letting $t \geq 0$ then$$
	\begin{align}
		-7q -1 &\geq 0\\
		7q &\leq -1\\
		q &< 0
	\end{align}$$Therefore $s$ and $t$ cannot both be greater than or equal to zero simultaneously.
- $n=7s+9t$ with $s,t\geq 0$ has a solution for all $n\geq 48$ (weak induction):
	- Step $n=48$:
		48 = 7(3) + 9(3).
	- Step n+1:
		Note that $1=7(4)+9(-3)=7(-5)+9(4)$. By induction $n=7s+9t\geq 48$ for some $s,t\geq 0$. As $46=7(4) + 9(2)$, $s\geq 5$ or $t\geq 3$.
		- Case $s\geq 5$:$$
			\begin{align}
				n + 1 &= (7s + 9t) + (-5\cdot 7 + 4\cdot 9)\\
				&= (s - 5)7 + (t + 4)9
			\end{align}
			$$
			Where $s-5$, $t+4\geq 0$.
		- Case $t \geq 3$:$$
			\begin{align}
			n + 1 &= (7s + 9t) + (4\cdot 7 - 3 \cdot 9)\\
				&= (s + 4)7 + (t - 3)9
			\end{align}
			$$Where $s+4$, $t-3\geq0$.
	Therefore $n=7s+9t$ with $s,t\geq 0$ has a solution for all $n\geq 48$.
- $n=7s+9t$ with $s,t\geq 0$ has a solution for all $n\geq 48$ (strong induction):
	- Step $48 \leq n \leq 54$:
		$48 = 7(3) + 9(3)$, $49 = 7(7) + 9 (0)$, $50 = 7(2) + 9(4)$, $51=7(6) + 9(1)$, $52=7(1) + 9(5)$, $53=7(5) + 9(2)$, $54 = 7(0) + 9(6)$.
	- Step $n+1$:
		$n + 1 \geq 55$ so $n-6 \geq 48$, then$$
		\begin{align}
			n - 6 &= 7s + 9t&\text{for some $s,t\geq 0$}\\
			n + 1 &= 7s + 9t + 7\\
				&= 7(s+1) + 9t
		\end{align}$$
	Therefore $n=7s+9t$ with $s,t\geq 0$ has a solution for all $n\geq 48$.
So $\$47.00$ largest bet that cannot be made with chips worth $\$7.00$ and $\$9.00$.
