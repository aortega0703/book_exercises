Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers and let $d = \gcd(a, b)$ and $m = \operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$. If $t$ divides both $a$ and $b$, prove that $t$ divides $d$. If $s$ is a multiple of both $a$ and $b$, prove that $s$ is a multiple of $m$.
##### Solution:
- If $t$ divides $a,b$ then $t$ divides $\gcd(a,b)$:
	By [[All Common Divisors Divide GCD]].
- If $a,b$ divide $s$ then $\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)$ divides $s$:
	By [[LCM Divides All Common Multiples]].
