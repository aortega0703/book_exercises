A transposition error involving distinct adjacent digits is one of the form $\dots ab\dots \to \dots ba \dots$ with $a \neq b$. Prove that the money order check-digit scheme will not detect such errors unless the check digit itself is transposed.
##### Solution:
For a $n+1$ digit number $d_n d_{n-1} \dots d_1 d_0$, $c=\sum_{i=0}^n d_i 10^i\ \operatorname{mod}\ 9$, then $c=\sum_{i=0}^n d_i\ \operatorname{mod}\ 9$. Addition is commutative so $c$ is the check digit for all permutations of the digits $d_n d_{n-1} \dots d_k \dots d_1 d_0$, meaning it does not detect transposition errors.
