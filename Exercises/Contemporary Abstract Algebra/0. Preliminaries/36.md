Suppose that there is a statement involving a positive integer parameter $n$ and you have an argument that shows that whenever the statement is true for a particular $n$ it is also true for $n + 2$. What remains to be done to prove the statement is true for every positive integer? Describe a situation in which this strategy would be applicable.
##### Solution:
We need to prove the statement holds for $n=1$ and $n=2$. The case $n=1$ proves the statement for all $n\equiv 1 \operatorname{mod} 2$ and the case $n=2$ proves it for all $n\equiv 0\operatorname{mod} 2$. This strategy is useful when a case analysis on the modulo classes of $n$ is easier than tackling the general case.
