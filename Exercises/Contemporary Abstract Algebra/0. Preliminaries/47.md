Suppose three consecutive digits $abc$ of an ISBN-10 are scrambled as $bca$. Which such errors will go undetected?
##### Solution:
$$
\begin{align}
	a(n+1) + bn + c(n-1) 
		&\equiv_{11} b(n+1) + cn + a(n-1)\\
	an + a + bn + cn - c
		&\equiv_{11} bn + b + cn + an - a\\
	2a &\equiv_{11} b + c
\end{align}
$$
Therefore errors are not detected when $2a\equiv b + c\ \operatorname{mod}\ 11$, independently of the position of the error.
