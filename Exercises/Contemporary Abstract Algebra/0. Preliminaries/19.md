Let $a, b, s$, and $t$ be integers. If $a \operatorname{mod} st = b \operatorname{mod} st$, show that $a \operatorname{mod} s = b \operatorname{mod} s$ and $a \operatorname{mod} t = b \operatorname{mod} t$. What condition on $s$ and $t$ is needed to make the converse true?
##### Solution:
By [[Product of Modulus]] (the condition is $\gcd(s,t)=1$).
