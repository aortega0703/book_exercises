Prove that every prime greater than $3$ can be written in the form $6n + 1$ or $6n + 5$.
##### Solution:
By [[Division algorithm]] for any prime $p=q6 + r$ for some $q,(0\leq r < 6)\in\mathbb{Z}$, then by cases
- Case $r=0$:
	$p=q6$ so $p$ is divisible by $6$ which contradicts primality.
- Case $r=2$:
	$p=q6 + 2 = 2(q3 + 1)$ so $p$ is divisible by $2$ which contradicts primality.
- Case $r=3$:
	$p=q6 + 3 = 3(q2 + 1)$ so $p$ is divisible by $3$ which contradicts primality.
- Case $r=4$:
	$p=q6+4=2(q3+2)$ so $p$ is divisible by $2$ which contradicts primality.
So $r=1$ or $r=5$.
