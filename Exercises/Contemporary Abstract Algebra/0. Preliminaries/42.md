Suppose that a money order identification number and check digit of $21720421168$ is erroneously copied as $27750421168$. Will the check digit detect the error?
##### Solution:
Let $n=21720421168$ and $n'=27750421168$, the only differing digits are $d_7=2$, $d_7'=5$ and $d_9=1$, $d_9'= 7$. $n\equiv n'\ \operatorname{mod}\ 9$ as $d_7+d_9\equiv d_7'+d_9'\ \operatorname{mod}\ 9$. So the check digit will not detect the error.
