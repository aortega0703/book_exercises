Let $\phi : G \to H$ be a morphism in a category $C$ with products. Explain why there is a unique morphism $(\phi \times \phi) : G \times G \to H \times H$ compatible in the evident way with the natural projections. (This morphism is defined explicitly for $C = \mathbf{Set}$ in ยง3.1.) \[ยง3.1, 3.2\].

There are morphisms $\pi_1\,;\phi:G\times G\to H$  and $\pi_2\,;\phi: G\times G \to H$, so by the universal property of $H\times H$ there is a unique morphism $\phi\times \phi:G\times G\to H\times H$ that makes the diagram commute.
