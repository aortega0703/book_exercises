Let $\phi : G -> H$ be a morphism in a category $C$ with products. Explain why there is a unique morphism $(\phi times \phi) : G times G -> H  times H$ compatible in the evident way with the natural projections. (This morphism is defined explicitly for $C = \mathbf{Set}$ in ยง3.1.) \[ยง3.1, 3.2\].

There are morphisms $\pi_1\,;\phi:G times G -> H$ and $\pi_2\,;\phi: G times G -> H$, so by the universal property of $H times H$ there is a unique morphism $\phi times \phi:G times G -> H times H$ that makes the diagram commute.
