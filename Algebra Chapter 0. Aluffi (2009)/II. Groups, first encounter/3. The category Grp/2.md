Let $\phi : G -> H$, $\psi : H -> K$ be morphisms in a category with products, and consider morphisms between the products $G times G$, $H times H$, $K times K$ as in Exercise 3.1. Prove that$$
(\psi \phi) times (\psi \phi) = (\psi times \psi)(\phi times \phi).
$$(This is part of the commutativity of the diagram displayed in ยง3.2.)
##### Solution:

As there are arrows $\pi_1\,;\phi\,;\psi:G times G -> K times K$ and $\pi_2\,;\phi\,;\psi:G times G -> K times K$, by the universal property of $K times K$, there is a unique arrow $(\phi\,;\psi) times(\phi\,;\psi):G times G -> K times K$ that can be factorized by $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$. Also
$$

	\pi_1\,;\phi\,;\psi
	&= (\phi times\phi)\,;\pi_1\,;\psi\
	&= (\phi times\phi)\,;(\psi times\psi)\,;\pi_1

$$So $\pi_1\,;\phi\,;\psi=\big((\phi times\phi)\,;(\psi times\psi)\big)\,;\pi_1$, similarly $\pi_2\,;\phi\,;\psi=\big((\phi times\phi)\,;(\psi times\psi)\big)\,;\pi_2$. By the universal property of $K times K$, $(\phi times\phi)\,;(\psi times\psi):G times G -> K times K$ is unique. Therefore $(\phi\,;\psi) times(\phi\,;\psi) = (\phi times\phi)\,;(\psi times\psi)$.
