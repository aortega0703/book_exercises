Prove that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ consists of precisely $n$ elements.
##### Solution:
By [[Division algorithm]] $0\leq m <n$ can be uniquely represented as $m=0q+r$, where $r=m$ clearly. Then there are at least $n$ elements ($[0],[1],\dots,[n-1]$). For any other value of $m\in\mathbb{Z}$ its modulus is in one of the existing equivalency classes as $0\leq r<n$. Then $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has exactly $n$ elements.
