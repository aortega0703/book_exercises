Prove that $ ZZ/n ZZ$ consists of precisely $n$ elements.
##### Solution:
By [[Division algorithm]] $0 lt.eq m <n$ can be uniquely represented as $m=0q+r$, where $r=m$ clearly. Then there are at least $n$ elements ($[0],[1],\dots,[n-1]$). For any other value of $m in ZZ$ its modulus is in one of the existing equivalency classes as $0 lt.eq r<n$. Then $ ZZ/n ZZ$ has exactly $n$ elements.
