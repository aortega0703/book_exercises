Prove that there are no nonzero integers $a, b, c$ such that $a^2+b^2 = 3c^2$ . (Hint: By studying the equation $a^2 + b^2 = 3c^2$ in $ ZZ/4 ZZ$, show that $a, b, c$ would all have to be even. Letting $a = 2k$, $b = 2l$, $c = 2m$, you would have $k^2 + l^2 = 3m^2$. Whatâ€™s wrong with that?)
##### Solution:
- $n^2\equiv_4 0$ with $n$ even:
$$

	(2n)^2
	&\equiv 4n^2 &(\text{mod}\ 4)\
	&\equiv 0 &(\text{mod}\ 4)\

$$
- $n^2\equiv_4 1$ with $n$ odd:
$$

	(2n+1)^2
	&\equiv 4n^2 +1 + 4n &(\text{mod}\ 4)\
	&\equiv 1 &(\text{mod}\ 4)\

$$
- if $a^2+b^2 = 3c^2$ then $a,b,c$ even:
	- $c$ odd:
		Suppose $c$ is odd, so $3c^2$ is also odd, being the sum of an even and an odd number. If $a^2$ (or $b^2$) is even/odd, then $a$ (or $b$) is also even/odd. But by the previous result $a^2+b^2\equiv 1\centernot\equiv 3 \equiv 3c^2\ (\text{mod }4)$, so $c$ can't be odd.
	- $c$ even:
		Suppose $c$ is even, so $3c^2$ is also even, being the sum of two odd or two even numbers. If $a^2$ and $b^2$ are odd, then $a$ and $b$ are also odd. But by the previous result $a^2 + b^2\equiv 2 \centernot\equiv 0 \equiv 3c^2\ (\text{mod }4)$ so $a$ and $b$ cannot be odd. If $a^2$ and $b^2$ are even, then $a$ and $b$ are also even. By the previous result $a^2+b^2\equiv 0 \equiv 3c^2\ (\text{mod }4)$, so it is a candidate.
	Then $a,b,c$ are all even.
- no non-zero solution:
	Let $a=2k$, $b=2l$, $c=2m$, then$$
	
		a^2 + b^2 &= 3c^2\
		(2k)^2 + (2l)^2 &= 3(2m)^2\
		4k^2 + 4l^2 &= 3(4m^2)\
		k^2 + l^2 &= 3m^2
	
	$$But then $k,l,m$ need to be all even too. As this situation is recursive $a,b,c$ would need to have an infinite number of $2$'s as factors which is a contradiction as they are natural numbers.
Therefore the only solution for the equation is $a=b=c=0$.
