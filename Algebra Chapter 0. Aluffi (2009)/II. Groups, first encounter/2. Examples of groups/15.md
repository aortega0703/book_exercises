Let $n > 0$ be an odd integer.
- Prove that if $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $\gcd(2m + n, 2n) = 1$. (Use Exercise 2.13.)
- Prove that if $\gcd(r, 2n) = 1$, then $\gcd(\frac{r+n}{2} , n) = 1$. (Ditto.)
- Conclude that the function $[m]_n |-> [2m + n]_{2n}$ is a bijection between $( ZZ/n ZZ)^*$ and $( ZZ/2n ZZ)^∗$.
The number $\phi(n)$ of elements of $( ZZ/n ZZ)^*$ is Euler’s $\phi$-function. The reader has just proved that if $n$ is odd, then $\phi(2n) = \phi(n)$. Much more general formulas will be given later on (cf. Exercise V.6.8).
