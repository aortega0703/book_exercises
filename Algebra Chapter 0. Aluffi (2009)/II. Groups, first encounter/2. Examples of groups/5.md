Describe generators and relations for all dihedral groups $D_{2n}$. (Hint: Let $x$ be the reflection about a line through the center of a regular $n$-gon and a vertex, and let $y$ be the counter-clockwise rotation by $2\pi/n$. The group $D_{2n}$ will be generated by $x$ and $y$, subject to three relations. To see that these relations really determine $D_{2n}$, use them to show that any product $x^{i_1} y^{i_2} x^{i_3} y^{i_4}\cdots$ equals $x^i y^j$ for some $i, j$ with $0 \leq i \leq 1$, $0 \leq j < n$.)
##### Solution:
By [[Dihedral group = symmetries of regular n-gon]].
