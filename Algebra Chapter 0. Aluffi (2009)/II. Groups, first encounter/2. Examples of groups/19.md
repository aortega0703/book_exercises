Both $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})^∗$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z})^∗$ consist of 4 elements. Write their multiplication tables, and prove that no re-ordering of the elements will make them match. (Cf. Exercise 1.6.)
##### Solution:

| $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})^∗$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ |
| ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $1$                          | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ |
| $2$                          | $2$ | $4$ | $1$ | $3$ |
| $3$                          | $3$ | $1$ | $4$ | $2$ |
| $4$                          | $4$ | $3$ | $2$ | $1$ |

| $(\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z})^∗$ | $1$  | $5$  | $7$  | $11$ |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $1$                           | $1$  | $5$  | $7$  | $11$ |
| $5$                           | $5$  | $1$  | $11$ | $7$  |
| $7$                           | $7$  | $11$ | $1$  | $5$  |
| $11$                          | $11$ | $7$  | $5$  | $1$  |
Every $a^2=e$ for every $a\in (\mathbb{Z}/12\mathbb{Z})^∗$, which is not the case in $(\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z})^∗$ ($2^2=3^3=4$). Then there is no reordering that will make them match.
