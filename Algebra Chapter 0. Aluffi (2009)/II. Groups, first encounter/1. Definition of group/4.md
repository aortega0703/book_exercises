Suppose that $g^2 = e$ for all elements $g$ of a group $G$; prove that $G$ is commutative.
##### Solution:
Let $a,b\in G$, then$$
\begin{align}
	(ab)(ab) &= e\\
	ab &= (ab)^{-1}\\
	&=b^{-1}a^{-1}\tag{1}\\
	&= ba\tag{2}
\end{align}
$$where $(1)$ is by [[Socks-shoes property]] and $(2)$ is by [[Notes/Group/Group/Uniqueness of inverse|Uniqueness of inverse]]. So $G$ is commutative.
