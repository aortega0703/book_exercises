Let $G$ be a finite abelian group with exactly one element $f$ of order $2$. Prove that $\prod_{g\in G} g = f$.
##### Solution:
Consider $\prod_{g\in G} g$, every element in $G$ has an inverse by definition (unique by [[Notes/Group/Group/Uniqueness of inverse|Uniqueness of inverse]]. By commutativity of $G$, the expression can be rearranged so that every element is next to its inverse, save from $f$ which is the only element whose inverse is itself. All pairs of elements then cancel out leaving only $f$.
