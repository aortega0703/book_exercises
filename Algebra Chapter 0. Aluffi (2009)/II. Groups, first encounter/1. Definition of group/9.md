Let $G$ be a finite group, of order $n$, and let $m$ be the number of elements $g  in G$ of order exactly $2$. Prove that $n âˆ’ m$ is odd. Deduce that if $n$ is even, then $G$ necessarily contains elements of order $2$.
##### Solution:
By [[Notes/Group/Group/Uniqueness of inverse|Uniqueness of inverse]] and [[Notes/Group/Group/Double inverse|Double inverse]], elements $g in G$ with $g != g^{-1}$ come in pairs, so there is an even number of them (say $2k$ for some $k in ZZ^+$). Then $2k+m+1=n$ (the $+1$ accounts for $e$), so $n-m=2k+1$ and is therefore odd. If $n$ is even then $m$ must be odd (and thus not $0$) for the parity to work.
