Consider the ‘sets of numbers’ listed in §1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as $+$ and $\cdot$. Even if the answer is negative (for example, $( ZZ, \cdot)$ is not a group), see if variations on the definition of these sets lead to groups (for example, $( ZZ^∗ , \cdot)$ is a group; cf. §1.4)
##### Solution:

| Set          | Group?                 | Modification            |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| $\emptyset$  | No, it has no identity | $\{e\}$, trivial group  |
| $ ZZ$ | No, it has no inverses |                         |
| $ ZZ$ | $( ZZ,+)$       |                         |
| $\mathbb{Q}$ | $(\mathbb{Q},+)$       | $(\mathbb{Q}^*, \cdot)$ |
| $ ZZ$ | $( ZZ,+)$       | $( ZZ^*,\cdot)$  |
| $ ZZ$ | $( ZZ,+)$       | $( ZZ^*, \cdot)$ |
