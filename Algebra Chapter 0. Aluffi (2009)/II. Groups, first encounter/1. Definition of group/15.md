Let $G$ be a commutative group, and let $g \in G$ be an element of maximal finite order, that is, such that if $h \in G$ has finite order, then $|h| \leq |g|$. Prove that in fact if $h$ has finite order in $G$, then $|h|$ divides $|g|$. (Hint: Argue by contradiction. If $|h|$ is finite but does not divide $|g|$, then there is a prime integer $p$ such that $|g| = p^mr$, $|h| = p^ns$, with $r$ and $s$ relatively prime to $p$ and $m < n$. Use Exercise 1.14 to compute the order of $g^{p^m} h^s$ .)

By [[Maximal order element is multiple of all orders]].
