Let $A, B$ be objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$, and let $f \in \operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A, B)$ be a morphism.
- Prove that if $f$ has a right-inverse, then $f$ is an epimorphism.
- Show that the converse does not hold, by giving an explicit example of a category and an epimorphism without a right-inverse.
##### Solution:
- Right inverse $\implies$ epimorphism:
	By [[Left-right inverse implies monic-epic]].
- Epimorphism $\centernot\implies$ right inverse:
	Consider the following category
	![[Algebra Chapter 0. Aluffi (2009)/I. Preliminaries. Set theory and categories/4. Morphisms/3.png]]
	It is clear that $f$ is an epimorphism ($\operatorname{id}_B\neq g \implies gf \neq  \operatorname{id}_B f=f$), but there is no arrow $B\to A$ that serves as its right inverse.
