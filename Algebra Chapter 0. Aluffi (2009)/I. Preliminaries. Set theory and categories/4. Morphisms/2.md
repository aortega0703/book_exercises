In Example 3.3 we have seen how to construct a category from a set endowed with a relation, provided this latter is reflexive and transitive. For what types of relations is the corresponding category a groupoid (cf. Example 4.6)?
##### Solution:
A relation induces a category with at most $1$ morphisms between any pair of objects, so for all arrows $f:A -> B$ to be isomorphic there must exist some arrow $f^{-1}:B -> A$ so that they can compose to the identity (the only arrow $A -> A$). This means that if $A\sim B$ then $B\sim A$, so $\sim$ must be commutative. Therefore when $\sim$ is an equivalence relation its induced category is a grupoid.
