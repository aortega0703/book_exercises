(Assuming some familiarity with linear algebra.) Define a category $V$ by taking $\operatorname{Obj}(V) =  ZZ$ and letting $\operatorname{Hom}_V(n, m) =$ the set of $m \times n$ matrices with real entries, for all $n, m  in  ZZ$. (I will leave the reader the task of making sense of a matrix with $0$ rows or columns.) Use product of matrices to define composition. Does this category ‘feel’ familiar?
##### Solution:
See [[Mat - category of matrices]], in the case of matrices $0\times n$, $n\times 0$, or $0\times 0$, they correspond to the [[Zero map]]. This category is similar to that of [[Preorder induces category]] without a unique (or no) morphism between elements.
