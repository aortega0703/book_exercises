Construct a category of infinite sets and explain how it may be viewed as a full subcategory of $\mathbf{Set}$.
##### Solution:
Let $\mathbf{Set}_ infty$ consist of
- Objects:
	$$A in \operatorname{Obj}(\mathbf{Set}_ infty)  <==> A in \operatorname{Obj}(\mathbf{Set}) \land |A|\notin ZZ$$
	Its objects are sets with non-natural (infinite) cardinality.
- Morphisms:
	$$
	\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}_ infty}(A,B)
	=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}}(A,B)
		$$
	Its morphisms are all functions (between infinite sets).
- Composition:
	Function composition as in $\mathbf{Set}$. For $A\overset{f}{\to}B\overset{g}{\to}C$ in $\mathbf{Set}_ infty$, $gf:A\to C$ exists as $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}_ infty}(A,C)	=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}}(A,C)$.
- Identities:
	For any $A in\mathbf{Set}_ infty$, $\operatorname{id}_A: A\to A$ exists as $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}_ infty}(A,A)=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathbf{Set}}(A,A)$.
- Unitality and associativity:
	Identities and composition are the same as in the category $\mathbf{Set}$ so unitality and associativity hold.
