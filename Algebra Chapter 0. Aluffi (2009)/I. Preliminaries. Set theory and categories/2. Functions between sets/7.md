Let $f : A → B$ be any function. Prove that the graph $Γ_f$ of $f$ is isomorphic to $A$.
##### Solution:
Let $\pi_A:\Gamma_A \to A$ be the canonical projection ($A\times B\to A$) restricted to $\Gamma_f\subseteq A\times B$.
- Injective:
	Let $a_1,a_2 in A$ and $b_1,b_2 in B$ such that $\pi_A(a_1,b_1)=\pi_A(a_2,b_2)$, so $a_1=a_2$. By definition there is a unique $b$ such that $(a,b) in\Gamma_f$ so $(a_1,b_1)=(a_2,b_2)$. Therefore $\pi_A$ is injective. 
- Surjective:
	Let $a in A$, then $\pi_A(a,f(a))=a$ so $\operatorname{Im}\pi_A=A$ and $\pi_A$ is surjective.
So $\pi_A: \Gamma_f \to A$  is bijective making $\Gamma_f$ isomorphic to $A$.
