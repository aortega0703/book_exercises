In view of Exercise 2.10, it is not unreasonable to use $2^A$ to denote the set of functions from an arbitrary set $A$ to a set with $2$ elements (say $\{0, 1\}$). Prove that there is a bijection between $2^A$ and the power set of $A$ (cf. ยง1.2).
##### Solution:
By [[Power set isomorphic to exponential]].
