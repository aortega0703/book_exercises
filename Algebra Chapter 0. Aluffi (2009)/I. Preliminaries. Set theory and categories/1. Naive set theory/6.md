Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $ ZZ$ of real numbers by setting $a \sim b  <==> b−a  in  ZZ$. Prove that this is an equivalence relation, and find a ‘compelling’ description for $ ZZ/\sim$. Do the same for the relation $ approx$ on the plane $ ZZ \times  ZZ$ defined by declaring $(a_1, a_2)  approx (b_1, b_2)  <==>$ $b_1 − a_1  in  ZZ$ and $b_2 − a_2  in  ZZ$.
##### Solution:
- $\sim$:
	See [[Contemporary Abstract Algebra/0. Preliminaries/48|48]].
- $ approx$:
	The proof is similar to that of $\sim$. The elements of any equivalence class are $ ZZ^2$ displaced by some vector.
