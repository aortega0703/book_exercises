Show that in every category $\mathcal{C}$ the products $A times B$ and $B times A$ are isomorphic, if they exist. (Hint: Observe that they both satisfy the universal property for the product of $A$ and $B$; then use Proposition 5.4.)
##### Solution:
$A times B$ (by definition) is final in $\mathcal{C}_{A,B}$, meaning that for any $A\overset{f}{\gets\;}\!\!S\overset{g}{ -> }B$ the following commutes in $\mathcal{C}$

Note that both diagrams describe the same situation, so $B times A$ is also final in $\mathcal{C}_{A,B}$, and by [[Terminal objects are unique up to unique iso]] $A times B\cong B times A$.
