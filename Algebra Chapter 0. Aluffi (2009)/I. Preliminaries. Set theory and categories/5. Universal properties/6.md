Consider the category corresponding to endowing (as in Example 3.3) the set $ ZZ^+$ of positive integers with the divisibility relation. Thus there is exactly one morphism $d \to m$ in this category if and only if $d$ divides $m$ without remainder; there is no morphism between $d$ and $m$ otherwise. Show that this category has products and coproducts. What are their ‘conventional’ names?
##### Solution:
- Products:
	Let $d$ be a common divisor of $n$ and $m$, then $d\to n$ and $d\to m$. By [[All Common Divisors Divide GCD]] $d$ also divides $\gcd(n,m)$, so the following commutes for all $d$.

	Then there is always a product for any pair of objects $n$, $m$, that being $\gcd(n,m)$.
- Coproducts:
	Let $p$ be a common multiple of $n$ and $m$, then $n\to p$ and $m\to p$. By [[Lcm Divides All Common Multiples]] $\text{lcm}(n,m)$ also divides $p$, so the following commutes for all $p$.
	![[6 Lcm is coproduct.png]]
	Then there is always a coproduct for any pair of objects $n$, $m$, that being $\text{lcm}(n,m)$.
