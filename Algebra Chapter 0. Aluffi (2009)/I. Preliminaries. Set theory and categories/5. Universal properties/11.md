Let $A$, resp. $B$ be a set, endowed with an equivalence relation $\sim_A$, resp. $\sim_B$. Define a relation $\sim$ on $A \times B$ by setting $$(a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2)  <==> a_1 \sim_A a_2 \text{ and } b_1 \sim_B b_2.$$(This is immediately seen to be an equivalence relation.)
- Use the universal property for quotients (ยง5.3) to establish that there are functions $(A \times B)/\!\!\sim\;\to A/\!\!\sim_A$, $(A \times B)/\!\!โผ\;\to B/\!\!\sim_B$.
- Prove that $(A\times B)/\!\!\sim$, with these two functions, satisfies the universal property for the product of $A/\!\!\sim_A$ and $B/\!\!\sim_B$.
- Conclude (without further work) that $(A \times B)/\!\!\sim\; \cong (A/\!\!\sim_A) \times (B/\!\!\sim_B)$.

By [[Quotient of product is product of quotients]].
