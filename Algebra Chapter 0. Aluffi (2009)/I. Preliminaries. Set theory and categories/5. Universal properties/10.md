Push the envelope a little further still, and define products and coproducts for families (i.e., indexed sets) of objects of a category. Do these exist in Set? It is common to denote the product $\underbrace{A \times \dots \times A}_{n \text{ times}}$ by $A^n$.
##### Solution:
For objects $\{A_i\}_{i in I}$, the product $\prod_{i in I} A_i$ should have morphisms $\pi_i: \prod_{i in I} A_i\to A_i$ for every $i in I$ and for every object $S$ with arrows $f_i: S\to a_i$ a unique morphism $\prod_{i in I} f_i: S \to \prod_{i in I} A_i$ such that $\pi_i \prod_{i in I} f_i = f_i$. The notion of coproduct dual, so it is obtained by reversing all arrows. An example in $\mathbf{Set}$ of such a product are real sequences, where $A_i= ZZ$ and $I= ZZ$.
