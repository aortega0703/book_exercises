Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with products. Find a reasonable candidate for the universal property that the product $A \times B \times C$ of three objects of $\mathcal{C}$ ought to satisfy, and prove that both $(A \times B) \times C$ and $A \times (B \times C)$ satisfy this universal property. Deduce that $(A \times B) \times C$ and $A \times (B \times C)$ are necessarily isomorphic.
##### Solution:
For any $S in\text{Obj}(\mathcal{C})$ with morphism $f:S\to A$, $g:S\to B$, and $h:S\to C$, the product $A\times B\times C$ should have a unique morphism $f\times g\times h: S \to A\times B\times C$ such that the following commutes

- $(A\times B)\times C\cong A\times B\times C$:
	By definition the product $A\times B$ with arrows $\pi_A: A\times B \to A$ and $\pi_B: A\times B\to B$ has a unique morphism $f\times g:S\to A\times B$ that makes the following commute

	Then $S$ has morphisms $f\times g:S\to A\times B$ and $h: S \to C$, so by definition the product $(A\times B)\times C$ with arrows $\pi_{A\times B}: (A\times B)\times C \to A\times B$ and $\pi_C: (A\times B)\times C \to C$ has a unique morphism $(f\times g)\times h$ that makes the following commute

	Then the following commutes

	Meaning$$
	
		f&=\pi_A (f\times g)\
		&= \pi_A \pi_{A\times B} ((f\times g)\times h)\
		g&=\pi_B(f\times g)\
		&=\pi_B\pi_{A\times B}((f\times g)\times h)\
		h&=\pi_C ((f\times g)\times h)
	
	$$So $(A\times B)\times C$ has the same universal property as $A\times B\times C$, making them isomorphic.	
- $A\times (B\times C) \cong A\times B\times C$:
	By definition the product $B\times C$ with arrows $\pi_B: B\times C \to B$ and $\pi_C: B\times C\to C$ has a unique morphism $g\times h:S\to B\times C$ that makes the following commute
	![[9 BxC.png]]
	Then $S$ has morphisms $f:S\to A$ and $g\times h: S \to B\times C$, so by definition the product $A\times(B\times C)$ with arrows $\pi_A: A\times(B\times C) \to A$ and $\pi_{B\times C}: A\times(B\times C) \to B$ has a unique morphism $f\times (g\times h)$ that makes the following commute
	![[9 Ax(BxC).png]]
	Then the following commutes
	![[9 Ax(BxC) full.png]]
	Meaning$$
	
		f&=\pi_A (f\times(g\times h))\
		g&=\pi_B(g\times h)\
		&=\pi_B\pi_{B\times C}(f\times (g\times h))\
		h&=\pi_C(g\times h)\
		&=\pi_C \pi_{B\times C}(f\times (g\times h))
	
	$$So $A\times (B\times C)$ has the same universal property as $A\times B\times C$, making them isomorphic.
Then $(A\times B)\times C \cong A\times (B\times C) \cong A\times B\times C$.
