Prove that a final object in a category $cal(C)$ is initial in the opposite category $cal(C)^\text{op}$.
##### Solution:
Let $F$ be a final object in $cal(C)$, then$$
 forall A in cal(C). |\text{Hom}_cal(C)(A,F)|=1
$$By definition $f in \text{Hom}_cal(C)(A,F) <==> f in \text{Hom}_{cal(C)^\text{op}}(F,A)$ so$$
 forall A in cal(C). |\text{Hom}_cal(C)(F,A)|=1
$$Therefore $F$ is initial in $cal(C)^\text{op}$.
