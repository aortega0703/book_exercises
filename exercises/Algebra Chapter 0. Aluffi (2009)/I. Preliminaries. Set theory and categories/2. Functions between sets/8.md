Describe as explicitly as you can all terms in the canonical decomposition (cf. ยง2.8) of the function $ ZZ -> ZZ$ defined by $r |-> e^{2\pi ir}$. (This exercise matches one assigned previously. Which one?)
##### Solution:
The terms of the decomposition are $[\cdot]: ZZ\twoheadrightarrow[0,1)$, $\tilde{r}: [0,1) arrow.r.tilde S$ (with $S$ being the complex unit circle) and $i:S\hookrightarrow ZZ$.
- $[\cdot]$:
	It sends every $r in ZZ$ to the interval $[0,1)$ by taking its fractional part.
- $\tilde{r}$:
	It maps the interval $[0,1)$ to the complex unit circle. This justifies the codomain of $[\cdot]$ as the real line "wraps" around the circle.
- $i$:
	It simply injects the complex unit circle into the complex plane.
This is similar to exercise [[Algebra Chapter 0. Aluffi (2009)/I. Preliminaries. Set theory and categories/1. Naive set theory/6|1.6]] as in the equivalence relation defined by $[\cdot]$ is the same.
