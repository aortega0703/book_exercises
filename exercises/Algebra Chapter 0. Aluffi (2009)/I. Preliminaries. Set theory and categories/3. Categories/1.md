Let $cal(C)$ be a category. Consider a structure $cal(C)^op("op")$ with
- $op("Obj")(cal(C)^op("op")) := op("Obj")(cal(C))$; 
- for $A$, $B$ objects of $cal(C)^op("op")$ (hence objects of $cal(C)$), $op("Hom")_{cal(C)^op("op")} (A, B) := op("Hom")_cal(C)(B, A)$. 
Show how to make this into a category (that is, define composition of morphisms in $cal(C)^op("op")$ and verify the properties listed in §3.1). Intuitively, the ‘opposite’ category $cal(C)^op("op")$ is simply obtained by ‘reversing all the arrows’ in $cal(C)$.

See [[Opposite category]].
