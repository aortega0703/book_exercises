Define the notions of fibered products and fibered coproducts, as terminal objects of the categories $C_{α,β}$, $C^{α,β}$ considered in Example 3.10 (cf. also Exercise 3.11), by stating carefully the corresponding universal properties. As it happens, Set has both fibered products and coproducts. Define these objects ‘concretely’, in terms of naïve set theory.
##### Solution:
- Fibered product:
	![[12 fibered product.png]]
	For morphisms $A\overset{\alpha}{ -> }S\overset{\ \ \beta}{\gets}B$ the fibered product $A times_S B$ over $\alpha$ and $\beta$ has arrows $A\overset{\ \ \pi_A}{\gets}A times_S B\overset{\pi_B\ \ }{ -> }B$ such that for any $A\overset{\ \ f}{\gets}X\overset{g\ \ }{ -> }B$ there exist a unique $f times g:X -> A times_S B$ that makes the previous diagram commute.
	- $\mathbf{Set}$:
		Let $A times_S B \subset A times B$ such that for any $(a,b) in A times_S B$, $\alpha(a)=\beta(b)$. Consider $X$ such that for any $x in X$, $\alpha f (x)=\beta g(x)$, then$$
		
			\begin{aligned}
				f(x) &= \pi_A (f(x),g(x))\
				&= \pi_A (f times g)(x)
			\end{aligned}\qquad
			\begin{aligned}
				g(x) &= \pi_B (f(x),g(x))\
				&= \pi_B (f times g)(x)
			\end{aligned}
		
		$$So $f times g$ makes the previous diagram commute, meaning $A times_S B$ is indeed a fibered product in $\mathbf{Set}$.
- Fibered coproduct:
	![[12 fibered coproduct.png]]
	For morphisms $A\overset{\ \alpha}{\gets}S\overset{\ \beta}{ -> }B$ the fibered product $A+_S B$ over $\alpha$ and $\beta$ has arrows $A\overset{\ i_A}{ -> }A+_S B\overset{i_B}{\gets}B$ such that for any $A\overset{f}{ -> }X\overset{\ \ g}{\gets}B$ there exist a unique $f+g:A+_S B -> X$ that makes the previous diagram commute.
	- $\mathbf{Set}$:
		Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $A+B$ such that for $a in A$ and $b in B$, $(A,a)\sim (B,b) <==> a=\alpha(s) \land b=\beta(s)$ for some $s in S$. Denote $(A+B)/\!\!\sim$ by $A+_S B$ and let$$
		
			f+g: (A+B)/\!\!\sim & -> X\
			[(Y, y)] & |->  
			\begin{cases}
				f(y) &\text{if $Y= A$}\
				g(y) &\text{if $Y= B$}\
			\end{cases}
		$$which is well defined as if $[(A,a)]=[(B,b)]$, then $(f+g)[(A,a)]=f(a)=g(b)=(f+g)[(A,a)]$. Consider $X$ such that $f\alpha(s)= g\beta(s)$, then$$
		
			\begin{aligned}
				f(a) &= (f+g)[(A,a)]\
				&= (f+g)\pi(A,a)\
				&= (f+g)\pi i(a)\
			\end{aligned}\qquad
			\begin{aligned}
				g(b) &= (f+g)[(B,b)]\
				&= (f+g)\pi(B,b)\
				&= (f+g)\pi i(b)\
			\end{aligned}
		
			$$So $f+g$ makes the diagram commute, meaning $A+_S B$ is indeed a fibered coproduct in $\mathbf{Set}$.
