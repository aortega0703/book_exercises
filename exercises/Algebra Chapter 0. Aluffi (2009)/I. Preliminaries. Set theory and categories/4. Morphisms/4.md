Prove that the composition of two monomorphisms is a monomorphism. Deduce that one can define a subcategory $cal(C)_op("mono")$ of a category $cal(C)$ by taking the same objects as in $cal(C)$ and defining $op("Hom")_{cal(C)_op("mono")} (A, B)$ to be the subset of $op("Hom")_cal(C)(A, B)$ consisting of monomorphisms, for all objects $A$, $B$. (Cf. Exercise 3.8; of course, in general $cal(C)_op("mono")$ is not full in $cal(C)$.) Do the same for epimorphisms. Can you define a subcategory $cal(C)_op("nonmono")$ of $cal(C)$ by restricting to morphisms that are not monomorphisms?
##### Solution:
- $cal(C)_op("mono")$:
	- Identities:
		By [[Identity is iso]] and [[Left-right inverse implies monic-epic]] $op("id")_A:A\rightarrowtail A$ is mono for all $A inop("Obj")(cal(C))$, so $op("id")_A in op("Hom")_{cal(C)_op("mono")}$.
	- Composition:
		By [[Composition of monics-epics is monic-epic]] if $A\overset{f}{\rightarrowtail}B\overset{g}{\rightarrowtail}C$ are mono in $cal(C)$, then $gf:A \rightarrowtail C$ is also mono, so $gf inop("Hom")_{cal(C)_op("mono")}$.
	- Unitality and Associativity:
		As composition is the same as in $cal(C)$, unitality of identities and associativity of composition holds.
- $cal(C)_op("epi")$:
	- Identities:
		By [[Identity is iso]] and [[Left-right inverse implies monic-epic]] $op("id")_A:A\twoheadrightarrow A$ is epi for all $A inop("Obj")(cal(C))$, so $op("id")_A in op("Hom")_{cal(C)_op("epi")}$.
	- Composition:
		By [[Composition of monics-epics is monic-epic]] if $A\overset{f}{\twoheadrightarrow}B\overset{g}{\twoheadrightarrow}C$ are epi in $cal(C)$, then $gf:A \rightarrowtail C$ is also epi, so $gf inop("Hom")_{cal(C)_op("epi")}$.
	- Unitality and Associativity:
		As composition is the same as in $cal(C)$, unitality of identities and associativity of composition holds.
- $cal(C)_op("nonmono")$:
	$cal(C)_op("nonmono")$ does not define a category as it would leave out identities.
