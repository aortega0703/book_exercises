Find the orders of the groups of symmetries of the five ‘platonic solids’.
##### Solution:
- Tetrahedron ($4$ vertices, $6$ edges, $4$ faces):
	- $12$ rotations:
		- Identity.
		- $8$ vertex-face rotations ($2$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_6$).
		- $3$ edge rotations ($1$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_4$).
	A reflection followed by each of the rotations gives a total of $24$ symmetries.
- Cube ($8$ vertices, $12$ edges, $6$ faces):
	- $24$ rotations:
		- Identity.
		- $8$ vertex rotations ($2$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_6$).
		- $6$ edge rotations ($1$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_4$).
		- $9$ face rotations ($3$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_8$).
	A reflection followed by each of the rotations gives a total of $48$ symmetries.
- Octahedron ($6$ vertices, $12$ edges, $8$ faces):
	- $24$ rotations:
		- Identity.
		- $9$ vertex rotations ($3$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_8$).
		- $6$ edge rotations ($1$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_4$).
		- $8$ face rotations ($2$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_6$).
	A reflection followed by each of the rotations gives a total of $48$ symmetries.
- Icosahedron ($12$ vertices, $30$ edges, $20$ faces):
	- $60$ rotations:
		- Identity.
		- $24$ vertex rotations ($4$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_{10}$).
		- $15$ edge rotations ($1$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_3$).
		- $20$ face rotations ($2$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_6$).
	A reflection followed by each of the rotations gives a total of $120$ symmetries.
- Dodecahedron ($20$ vertices, $30$ edges, $12$ faces):
	- $60$ rotations:
		- Identity.
		- $20$ vertex rotations ($2$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_6$).
		- $15$ edge rotations ($1$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_4$).
		- $24$ face rotations ($4$ for each opposite pair, looks like $D_{10}$).
	A reflection followed by each of the rotations gives a total of $120$ symmetries.
