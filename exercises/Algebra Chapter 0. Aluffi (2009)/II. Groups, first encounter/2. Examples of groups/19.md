Both $( ZZ/5 ZZ)^∗$ and $( ZZ/12 ZZ)^∗$ consist of 4 elements. Write their multiplication tables, and prove that no re-ordering of the elements will make them match. (Cf. Exercise 1.6.)
##### Solution:

| $( ZZ/5 ZZ)^∗$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ |
| ---------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $1$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$ | $4$ |
| $2$ | $2$ | $4$ | $1$ | $3$ |
| $3$ | $3$ | $1$ | $4$ | $2$ |
| $4$ | $4$ | $3$ | $2$ | $1$ |

| $( ZZ/12 ZZ)^∗$ | $1$ | $5$ | $7$ | $11$ |
| ----------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| $1$ | $1$ | $5$ | $7$ | $11$ |
| $5$ | $5$ | $1$ | $11$ | $7$ |
| $7$ | $7$ | $11$ | $1$ | $5$ |
| $11$ | $11$ | $7$ | $5$ | $1$ |
Every $a^2=e$ for every $a in ( ZZ/12 ZZ)^∗$, which is not the case in $( ZZ/5 ZZ)^∗$ ($2^2=3^3=4$). Then there is no reordering that will make them match.
