For every positive integer $n$ construct a group containing elements $g, h$ such that $|g| = 2$, $|h| = 2$, and $|gh| = n$. (Hint: For $n > 1$, $D_{2n}$ will do.)
##### Solution:
- $n=1$:
	Consider the only group of order $3$, which is given by

| $\cdot$ | $e$ | $g$ | $h$ |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| e | $e$ | $g$ | $h$ |
| $g$ | $g$ | $h$ | $e$ |
| $h$ | $h$ | $e$ | $g$ |
	Note that $|g|=|h|=2$ and $|gh|=|e|=1$.
- $n>1$:
	Consider $D_{2n}$ with $g=\tau$ and $h=\sigma\tau$, then $g^2=\tau^2=e$ and $h^2=(\sigma\tau)^2=\sigma\tau\sigma\tau=\sigma\sigma^{-1}=e$, so $|g|=|h|=2$. Also consider $gh=\tau(\sigma\tau)=\sigma^{-1}$, and by [[Inverses preserve order]] $|gh|=|\sigma^{-1}|=|\sigma|=n$.
