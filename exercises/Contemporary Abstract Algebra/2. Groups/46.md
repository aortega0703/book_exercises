In a finite group, show that the number of non-identity elements that satisfy the equation $x^5 = e$ is a multiple of $4$. If the stipulation that the group be finite is omitted, what can you say about the number of non-identity elements that satisfy the equation $x^5 = e$?
##### Solution:
- $|\{x: x^5 = e\}|\equiv 0\ op("mod") 4$:
	If $x^5=e$ then $(x^2)^5=x^{10}=(x^5)^2=e$, $(x^3)^5=x^{15}=(x^5)^3=e$, and $(x^4)^5=x^{20}=(x^5)^4=e$.
	- $x^2 != x$:
		Suppose $x^2=x$, then $x=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis.
	- $x^3 != x$:
		Suppose $x^3=x$, then $x^2=e$, so $x=e x=x^5 x=x^6=(x^2)^3=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis
	- $x^3 != x^2$:
		Suppose $x^3=x^2$, then $x=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis.
	- $x^4 != x$:
		Suppose $x^4 = x$, then $x^3=e$, so $x=ex=x^5 x=x^6=(x^3)^2=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis.
	- $x^4 != x^2$
		Suppose $x^4=x^2$, then $x^2=e$, so $x=ex=x^5 x=x^6=(x^2)^3=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis.
	- $x^4 != x^3$:
		Suppose $x^4=x^3$, then $x=e$ which contradicts the hypothesis.
	So $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$, $x^4$ are all distinct and satisfy the equation, so the total number of elements that do is multiple of $4$.
- $G$ is non-finite:
	If $G$ is non-finite then the number of elements that satisfy the property can be a multiple of $4$ or infinite.
