For a positive integer $n$ let $S_n$ be the set of all $1$-$1$ functions from $\{1, 2, \dots , n\}$ to itself. What is the identity under the operation of function composition? Does every element of $S_n$ have an inverse in $S_n$ under this operation? Is $S_n$ closed under this operation? Is $S_n$ a group under this operation? How many elements are in $S_n$?
##### Solution:
- Identity:
	Consider $op("id")(x)=x$, then $(f compose op("id"))(x)=f(op("id")(x))=f(x)$ and $(op("id") compose f)(x)=op("id")(f(x))=f(x)$, so $op("id")(x)=x$ is the identity.
- Inverses:
	Let $f in S_n$, as $f$ is injective $op("Dom")(f) subset.eq Im (f) subset.eq op("Ran")(f)$ but $op("Dom")(f) = op("Ran")(f)$ so $ Im (f) = op("Ran")(f)$ meaning it is also surjective and therefore bijective. Then by [[Composition of injectives-surjectives is injective-surjective]] $f$ has an inverse $f^{-1}$.
- Closed:
	Let $f,g in S_n$, then $f,g:\{1,2,\dots,n\} -> \{1,2,\dots,n\}$, so $f compose g,\ g compose f: \{1,2,\dots,n\} -> \{1,2,\dots,n\}$. Then $S_n$ is closed.
- Associativity:
	By [[Composition of injectives-surjectives is injective-surjective]].
Then $S_n$ is a group. For $f in S_n$, $f(1)$ has $n$ possible values, as $2 != 1$ then $f(2) != f(1)$ (by injectivity) so $f(2)$ has $n-1$ possible values and so on, so $|S_n| = n!$.
