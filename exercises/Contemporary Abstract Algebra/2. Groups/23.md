An abstract algebra teacher intended to give a typist a list of nine integers that form a group under multiplication modulo $91$. Instead, one of the nine integers was inadvertently left out, so that the list appeared as $1, 9, 16, 22, 53, 74, 79, 81$. Which integer was left out? (This really happened!)
##### Solution:
$22^2\equiv 484 \equiv 29\ op("mod")\ 91$. So the missing number is $29$ for the group to be closed.
