Prove that every group table is a Latin square ; that is, each element of the group appears exactly once in each row and each column.
##### Solution:
Suppose two equal entries $ab=ac$, then multiplying by $a^{-1}$ on both sides we get $b=c$, so the row entries are unique. Similarly the column entries are unique too.
