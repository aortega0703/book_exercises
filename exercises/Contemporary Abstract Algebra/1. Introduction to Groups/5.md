For $n \geq 3$, describe the elements of $D_n$. (Hint: You will need to consider two cases, $n$ even and $n$ odd.) How many elements does $D_n$ have?
##### Solution:
Label the vertices in a regular $n$-gon from $0$ to $n-1$ clockwise, and let the midpoint between $n$ and $n+1\ (op("mod") n)$ be $n + 1/2$.
- Rotations:
	$D_n$ has $n$ rotations, labelled from $0$ to $n-1$. Rotation $k$ rotates the $n$-gon by $360\degree k/n$, moving vertex $c$ to position $c + k\ (op("mod")\ n)$.
- Reflections:
	$D_n$ has $n$ reflections, labelled from $0$ to $n-1$.
	- $n$ odd:
		Reflection $k$ reflects the $n$-gon over the line from vertex $k$ to the midpoint $k+n/2\ (op("mod")\ n)$, moving vertex $c$ to position $-c + 2k\ (op("mod")\ n)$.
	- $n$ even:
		Reflection $k$ reflects the $n$-gon over the line from vertex/midpoint $k/2$ to vertex/midpoint $(k+n)/2$, moving vertex $c$ to position $-c + k\ (op("mod")\ 2)$.
Then $D_n$ has $2n$ elements.
