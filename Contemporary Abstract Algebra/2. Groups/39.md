Suppose $F_1$ and $F_2$ are distinct reflections in a dihedral group $Dn$. Prove that $F_1F_2 \neq R_0$.
##### Solution:
Suppose $F_1F_2 = R_0$, then $F_1 = F_2^{-1}$. By [[Notes/Group/Group/Uniqueness of inverse|Uniqueness of inverse]] inverses are unique, and since $F_1$ is its own inverse $F_1=F_2$ which is a contradiction with the hypothesis. Therefore $F_1F_2 \neq R_0$.
