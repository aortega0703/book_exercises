(Socks–Shoes Property) Draw an analogy between the statement $(ab)^{−1} = b^{−1}a^{−1}$ and the act of putting on and taking off your socks and shoes. Find distinct non-identity elements $a$ and $b$ from a non-Abelian group such that $(ab)^{−1} = a^{−1} b^{−1}$ . Find an example that shows that in a group, it is possible to have $(ab)^{−2}  != b^{−2}a^{−2}$ . What would be an appropriate name for the group property $(abc)^{−1} = c^{−1} b^{−1}a^{−1}$?
##### Solution:
- Analogy:
	You have to remove your socks and shoes in the reverse order that you put them in.
- $(ab)^{−1} = a^{−1} b^{−1}$:
	In $D_3$, $(R_{120}R_{240})^{-1}=R_0^{-1}=R_0=R_{240}R_{120}=R_{120}^{-1}R_{240}^{-1}$.
- $(ab)^{−2}  != b^{−2}a^{−2}$:
	In $D_3$,$$
	
		\begin{aligned}
			(R_{120}F_1)^{-2}
			&= F_3^{-2}\
			&= R_0^{-1}\
			&= R_0
		\end{aligned}\qquad
		\begin{aligned}
			F_1^{-2}R_{120}^{-2}
			&= R_0^{-1} R_{240}^{-1}\
			&= R_0 R_{120}\
			&= R_{120}
		\end{aligned}
	
	$$
- Name for $(abc)^{−1} = c^{−1} b^{−1}a^{−1}$:
	Bra-shirt-jacket.
