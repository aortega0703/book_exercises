Prove the assertion made in Example $20$ that the set $\{1, 2, \dots , n â€“ 1\}$ is a group under multiplication modulo $n$ if and only if $n$ is prime.
##### Solution:
- $n$ is prime $ ==> \{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ is group:
	If $n$ is prime then every $1 lt.eq m < n$ is coprime to $n$, so $U(n)=\{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ which is a group by [[Group of units mod n]].
- $\{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ is group $ ==> n$ is prime:
	Let $n$ not a prime, then $n=pq$ for some $1<p,q<n$, then $p\cdot q \equiv 0\ op("mod")\ n$. As $0\notin \{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ the set is not closed under the operation and therefore not a group.
