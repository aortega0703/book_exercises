Show that $\{1, 2, 3\}$ under multiplication modulo $4$ is not a group but that $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ under multiplication modulo $5$ is a group.
##### Solution:
- $\{1, 2, 3\}$:
	$2\cdot2\equiv 0\ \operatorname{mod}\ 4$ so the set is not closed under multiplication, and therefore not a group.
- $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$:
	- Associativity:
		By [[Modular multiplication properties]].
	- Identity:
		Has identity $1$ by [[Modular multiplication properties]].
	- Inverses:
		$1^{-1}\equiv_5 1$, $2^{-1}\equiv_5 3$, $3^{-1}\equiv_5 2$, $4^{-1}\equiv_5 4$.
	Therefore the set is a group with said operation.
