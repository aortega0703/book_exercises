Let $R$ be any fixed rotation and $F$ any fixed reflection in a dihedral group. Prove that $FR^kF = R^{âˆ’k}$ . Why does this imply that $D_n$ is non-Abelian?
##### Solution:
By definition $FRF= R^{-1}$ so $RF=FR^{-1}$, then $FR^{k}F=FFR^{-k}=R^{-k}$. If $D_n$ were Abelian then $FR^{k}F=FFR^k=R^k$, but $R^k\neq R^{-k}$ save from $R_{0}$ and $R_{180}$.
