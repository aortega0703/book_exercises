(Law of Exponents for Abelian Groups) Let $a$ and $b$ be elements of an Abelian group and let $n$ be any integer. Show that $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ . Is this also true for non-Abelian groups?
##### Solution:
By [[Law of exponents for commutative elements]]. This is not true for non-Abelian groups, e.g. in $D_3$ $(R_{120} F_1)^2=R_0\neq R_{240}=R_{120}^2 F_1^2$.
