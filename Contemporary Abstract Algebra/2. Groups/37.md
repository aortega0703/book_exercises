Let $G$ be a finite group and $n$ an odd positive integer. Show that the number of elements $x$ of $G$ such that $x^n = e$ is odd. Show that the number of elements $x$ of $G$ such that $x^2 \neq e$ is even.
##### Solution:
- $x^n = e$:
	$e^n = e$ is one such element. Then$$
	\begin{align}
		x^n &= e\\
		x^n x^{-n} &= x^{-n}\\
		e &= (x^{-1})^n
	\end{align}
	$$Suppose $x=x^{-1}$, then $x^m=e$ for $m$ even, so $x^n=x\neq e$ as $n$ is odd which contradicts the assumption. Then $x\neq x^{-1}$ so these elements (apart from $e$) come in pairs, adding to an odd number in total.
- $x^2 \neq e$:
	If $x^2 \neq e$ then $x \neq x^{-1}$ and $e\neq (x^{-1})^2$ so they come in pairs, adding to an even number in total.
