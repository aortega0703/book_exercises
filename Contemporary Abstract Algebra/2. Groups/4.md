Which of the following sets are closed under the given operation?
1. $\{0, 4, 8, 12\}$ addition $\operatorname{mod}\ 16$.
2. $\{0, 4, 8, 12\}$ addition $\operatorname{mod}\ 15$.
3. $\{1, 4, 7, 13\}$ multiplication $\operatorname{mod}\ 15$.
4. $\{1, 4, 5, 7\}$ multiplication $\operatorname{mod}\ 9$.
##### Solution:
1. $\{0, 4, 8, 12\}$ addition $\operatorname{mod}\ 16$:
	 $1\cdot 4\equiv_{16}4$, $2\cdot 4\equiv_{16}8$, $3\cdot 4\equiv_{16}12$, $4\cdot 4\equiv_{16} 0$, then $\{0, 4, 8, 12\}=\langle 4\rangle\subseteq  ZZ/16$ which is then a group by [[Cyclic subgroup]] and therefore closed.
2. $\{0, 4, 8, 12\}$ addition $\operatorname{mod}\ 15$:
	The set is not closed as $4+12\equiv 1\ \operatorname{mod}\ 15$.
3. $\{1, 4, 7, 13\}$ multiplication $\operatorname{mod}\ 15$:
	$7^1\equiv_{15} 7$, $7^2\equiv_{15} 4$, $7^3 \equiv_{15}13$, $7^4\equiv_{15} 1$,then $\{1, 4, 7, 13\}=\langle 7\rangle\subseteq U(15)$ which is then a group by [[Cyclic subgroup]] and therefore closed.
4. $\{1, 4, 5, 7\}$ multiplication $\operatorname{mod}\ 9$:
	The set is not closed as $4\cdot 5\equiv 2\ \operatorname{mod}\ 9$.
