Let $\mathbb{Q}^+$ denote the positive rational numbers. Explain why the correspondence from $\mathbb{Q}^+ \times \mathbb{Q}^+$ that takes $( \frac{a}{b} , \frac{c}{d} )$ to $\frac{a+c}{b+d}$ is not a binary operation on $\mathbb{Q}^+$. (That is, the correspondence is not well-defined.)
##### Solution:
$\left(\frac{1}{1},\frac{2}{1}\right)\mapsto \frac{3}{2}$ and $\left(\frac{2}{2},\frac{2}{1}\right)\mapsto \frac{4}{3}$ even though $\left(\frac{1}{1},\frac{2}{1}\right)=\left(\frac{2}{2},\frac{2}{1}\right)$. As an element can be assigned multiple images the correspondence is not a binary operation (not a function).
