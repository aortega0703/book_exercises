Translate each of the following multiplicative expressions into its additive counterpart. Assume that the operation is commutative. 
1. $a^2 b^3$
2. $a^{−2} (b^{−1} c)^2$
3. $(ab^2 )^{−3} c^2 = e$
##### Solution:
1. $a^2 b^3$:
	$2a+3b$.
2. $a^{−2} (b^{−1} c)^2$:
	$-2a+2(-b+c)$.
3. $(ab^2 )^{−3} c^2 = e$
	$-3(a + 2b) + 2c = 0$.
