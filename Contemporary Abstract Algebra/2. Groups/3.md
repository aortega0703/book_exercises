Which of the following binary operations are commutative?
1. Subtraction of integers.
2. Division of nonzero rationals.
3. Function composition of polynomials with real coefficients.
4. Multiplication of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries.
5. Exponentiation of integers.
##### Solution:
1. Subtraction of integers:
	Subtraction is not commutative as $2-1=1 !=-1=1-2$.
2. Division of nonzero rationals:
	Division is not commutative as $2/1=2 !=0.5=1/2$.
3. Function composition of polynomials with real coefficients:
	Let $f(x)=x^2$, $g(x)=x+1$, function composition is not commutative as $(g\circ f)(x)=g(x^2)=x^2+1 != x^2+2x+1=f(x+1)=(f\circ g)(x)$.
4. Multiplication of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries:
	Matrix multiplication is not commutative as$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1\
		0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0\
		1 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		2 & 1\
		1 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	 !=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1\
		1 & 2
	\end{bmatrix}
	=
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0\
		1 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 1\
		0 & 1
	\end{bmatrix}
	$$
5. Exponentiation of integers:
	Exponentiation is not commutative as $2^3=8 != 9=3^2$.
