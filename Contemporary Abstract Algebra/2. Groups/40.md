Suppose $F_1$ and $F_2$ are distinct reflections in a dihedral group $D_n$ such that $F_1F_2 = F_2F_1$. Prove that $F_1F_2 = R_{180}$.
##### Solution:
$$
\begin{align}
	F_1F_2 &= F_2F_1\\
	(F_1F_2)(F_1F_2) &= F_2 F_1 F_1F_2\\
	(F_1F_2)^2 &= R_0
\end{align}
$$Two consecutive reflections are a rotation, and the only rotation that is its own inverse is $R_{180}$.
