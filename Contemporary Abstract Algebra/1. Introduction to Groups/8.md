In $D_n$, explain geometrically why a rotation and a reflection taken together in either order must be a reflection.
##### Solution:
Label the vertices of the $n$-gon from $0$ to $n-1$ clockwise. A rotation keeps the orientation of the numbering unchanged, while a reflection flips the direction of the numbering. So a rotation after a reflection (or vice versa) reverses the original orientation.
