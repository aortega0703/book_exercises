In $D_n$, explain geometrically why a reflection followed by a reflection must be a rotation.
##### Solution:
Label the vertices of the $n$-gon from $0$ to $n-1$ clockwise. A rotation keeps the orientation of the numbering unchanged, while a reflection flips the direction of the numbering. So one reflection after another keeps the original orientation.
