Associate the number $1$ with a rotation and the number $âˆ’1$ with a reflection. Describe an analogy between multiplying these two numbers and multiplying elements of $D_n$.
##### Solution:
- $(1)(1)=1$ the same way two rotations are a rotation.
- $(-1)(-1) = 1$ the same way two reflections are a rotation.
- $(1)(-1)=(-1)(1)=-1$ the same way a reflection and a rotation are a reflection.
