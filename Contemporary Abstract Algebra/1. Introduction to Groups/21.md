Let $X$, $Y$, $R_{90}$ be elements of $D_4$ with $Y \neq R_{90}$ and $X^2Y = R_{90}$. Determine $Y$. Show your reasoning.
##### Solution:
- Case $X^2 = R_0$:
	$R_0 Y = R_{90}$, then $Y=R_{90}$ which is a contradiction with the hypothesis.
- Case $X^2=R_{180}$:
	$R_{180}Y = R_{90}$, then $Y=R_{270}$.
Therefore $Y=R_{270}$ is the only solution.
