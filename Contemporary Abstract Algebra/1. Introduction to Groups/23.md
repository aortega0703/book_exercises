Let $n$ be a positive integer greater than or equal to $3$. Prove that $D_n$ contains $R_{180}$ if and only if $n$ is even.
##### Solution:
- $R_{180}\in D_n \implies n\equiv 0\ (\operatorname{mod} 2)$:
	If $R_{180} \in D_n$ every vertex has to have another vertex at $180\degree$ from it. Since $2(180\degree)=360\degree=0\degree$ vertices come in pairs, then $n$ is even.
- $n\equiv 0\ (\operatorname{mod} 2)\implies R_{180}\in D_n$:
	Given a regular $n$-gon, there is a vertex every $360\degree/n$ of any vertex. If $n=2k$ (is even) there is a vertex at $360\degree k/(2k) = 180\degree$ of any vertex, then $R_{180}\in D_n$.
