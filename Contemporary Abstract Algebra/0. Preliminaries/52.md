Prove that $3$, $5$, and $7$ are the only three consecutive odd integers that are prime.
##### Solution:
Consider $2n+1$, $2n+3$, and $2n+5$
- $n \equiv 0\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$:
	Then $2n + 3 \equiv 0\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$. If $2n+3=3$ then $2n+1=1$ which is not prime. If $2n+3\neq3$ then $3\ | \ (2n+3)$ making it not prime.
- $n \equiv 1\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$:
	Then $2n + 1 \equiv 0\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$. The statement's triplet starts with $2n+1=3$. If $2n+1\neq 3$ then $3\ |\ (2n+1)$ making it not prime.
- $n \equiv 2\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$:
	Then $2n + 5 \equiv 0\ \operatorname{mod}\ 3$. If $2n+5=3$ then $2n+3=1$ which is not prime. If $2n+5\neq 3$ then $3\ | \ (2n+5)$ making it not prime.
Therefore the only three consecutive odd prime integers are $3$, $5$, $7$.
