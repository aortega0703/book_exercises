For $n=5,8,12,20,25$ find all positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$.
##### Solution:
The primes $p\leq 25$ are $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23$.
- $n=5$:
	$5$ is prime, so $1,2,3,4$ are relatively prime to $5$.
- $n=8$:
	$8=2^3$, so $1,3,5,7$ are relatively prime to $8$.
- $n=12$:
	$12=2^2\cdot 3$, so $1,5,7,11$ are relatively prime to $12$.
- $n=20$:
	$20=2^2\cdot 5$, so $1,3,7,9,11,13,17,19$ are relatively prime to $20$.
- $n=25$:
	$25=5^2$, so $1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24$ are relatively prime to $25$.
