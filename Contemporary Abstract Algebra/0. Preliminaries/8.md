Suppose $a$ and $b$ are integers that divide the integer $c$. If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, show that $ab$ divides $c$. Show, by example, that if $a$ and $b$ are not relatively prime, then $ab$ need not divide $c$.
##### Solution:
- If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, $ab$ divides $c$:
	By [[ab Divides c If Relative Primes]].
- if $a$ and $b$ are not relatively prime, then $ab$ need not divide $c$:
	$2|12$ and $4|12$, but $2\cdot 4 = 8 \nmid 12$.
