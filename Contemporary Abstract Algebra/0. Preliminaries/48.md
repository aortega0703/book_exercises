Let $S$ be the set of real numbers. If $a, b  in S$, define $a \sim b$ if $a âˆ’ b$ is an integer. Show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$. Describe the equivalence classes of $S$.
##### Solution:
- Reflexive:
	Let $x in S$, then $x-x=0 in ZZ$ so $x\sim x$.
- Commutative:
	Let $x,y in S$ such that $x-y=k in ZZ$, then  $y-x=-k in ZZ$ so $x\sim y \implies y\sim x$.
- Transitive:
	Let $x,y,z in S$ such that $x-y=k in ZZ$ and $y-z=n in ZZ$, then $x-z=k+n in ZZ$.
Therefore $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $S$.
- The equivalence classes are numbers with integer distance between them, with representatives $0 lt.eq r<1$:
	Let $x in S$, $x=x' + r$ where $x' in ZZ$ and $0 lt.eq r<1$. So the equivalence class of any number has a representative in $[0,1)$.
