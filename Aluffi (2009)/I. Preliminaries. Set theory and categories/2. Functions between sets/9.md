Show that if $A' \cong A''$ and $B' \cong B''$, and further $A'\cap B' = \emptyset$ and $A''\cap B'' = \emptyset$, then $A' \cup B' \cong A'' \cup B''$. Conclude that the operation $A \amalg B$ (as described in ยง1.4) is well-defined up to isomorphism (cf. ยง2.9).
##### Solution:
By [[Disjoint union is well-defined up to isomorphism]]. This shows that all candidates for $A \amalg B$ are isomorphic as long as the "copies" of $A$ and $B$ are disjoint.
