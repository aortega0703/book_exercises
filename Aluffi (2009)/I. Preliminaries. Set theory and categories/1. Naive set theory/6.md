Define a relation $\sim$ on the set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers by setting $a \sim b \iff b−a \in \mathbb{Z}$. Prove that this is an equivalence relation, and find a ‘compelling’ description for $\mathbb{R}/\sim$. Do the same for the relation $\approx$ on the plane $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ defined by declaring $(a_1, a_2) \approx (b_1, b_2) \iff$ $b_1 − a_1 \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b_2 − a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}$.
##### Solution:
- $\sim$:
	See [[Contemporary Abstract Algebra/0. Preliminaries/48|48]].
- $\approx$:
	The proof is similar to that of $\sim$. The elements of any equivalence class are $\mathbb{Z}^2$ displaced by some vector.
