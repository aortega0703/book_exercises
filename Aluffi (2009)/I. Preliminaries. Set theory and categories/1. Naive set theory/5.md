Give an example of a relation that is reflexive and symmetric but not transitive. What happens if you attempt to use this relation to define a partition on the set? (Hint: Thinking about the second question will help you answer the first one.)
##### Solution:
Consider the relation $\sim$ such that $a\sim b$ when $|a-b|\leq 1$ with $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$
- Reflexive:
	$|a-a|=0\leq 1$, so $a\sim a$.
- Symmetric:
	$|b-a|=|a-b|$, so $a\sim b \implies b\sim a$.
- Transitive:
	$|3-2|=1$, $|2-1|=1$, $|3-1|=2 > 1$, so $\sim$ is not transitive.
The "equivalence classes" of $\sim$ are $\overline{a}=\{a-1, a, a+1\}$, so for example $\overline{1}$ and $\overline{2}$ are different but not disjoint, so it does not partition $\mathbb{Z}$.
