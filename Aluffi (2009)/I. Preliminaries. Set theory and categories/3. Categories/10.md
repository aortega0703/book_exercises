Since the objects of a category $\mathcal{C}$ are not (necessarily interpreted as) sets, it is not clear how to make sense of a notion of ‘subobject’ in general. In some situations it does make sense to talk about subobjects, and the subobjects of any given object $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the morphisms $A \to \Omega$ for a fixed, special object $\Omega$ of $\mathcal{C}$, called a subobject classifier. Show that Set has a subobject classifier.
##### Solution:
As in [[Category of pointed sets]], the functions (morphisms) from any singleton to say a set $S$ are in direct correspondence with the elements of $S$. Therefore $\{*\}$ is the subobject classifier in $\mathbf{Set}$.
