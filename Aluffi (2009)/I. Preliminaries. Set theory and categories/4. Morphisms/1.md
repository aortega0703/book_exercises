Composition is defined for two morphisms. If more than two morphisms are given, e.g.,
![[Aluffi (2009)/I. Preliminaries. Set theory and categories/4. Morphisms/1.png]]
then one may compose them in several ways, for example:$$
	(ih)(gf),\quad (i(hg))f,\quad i((hg)f),\quad \text{etc}.
$$so that at every step one is only composing two morphisms. Prove that the result of any such nested composition is independent of the placement of the parentheses. (Hint: Use induction on $n$ to show that any such choice for $f_nf_{nâˆ’1} \dots f_1$ equals$$
	((\dots((f_n f_{n-1})f_{n-1})\dots)f_1).
$$Carefully working out the case n = 5 is helpful.)
