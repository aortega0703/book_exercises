Prove that the composition of two monomorphisms is a monomorphism. Deduce that one can define a subcategory $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}$ of a category $\mathcal{C}$ by taking the same objects as in $\mathcal{C}$ and defining $\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}} (A, B)$ to be the subset of $\operatorname{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A, B)$ consisting of monomorphisms, for all objects $A$, $B$. (Cf. Exercise 3.8; of course, in general $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}$ is not full in $\mathcal{C}$.) Do the same for epimorphisms. Can you define a subcategory $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{nonmono}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ by restricting to morphisms that are not monomorphisms?
##### Solution:
- $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}$:
	- Identities:
		By [[Identity is iso]] and [[Left-right inverse implies monic-epic]] $\operatorname{id}_A:A\rightarrowtail A$ is mono for all $A\in\operatorname{Obj}(\mathcal{C})$, so $\operatorname{id}_A\in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}}$.
	- Composition:
		By [[Composition of monics-epics is monic-epic]] if $A\overset{f}{\rightarrowtail}B\overset{g}{\rightarrowtail}C$ are mono in $\mathcal{C}$, then $gf:A \rightarrowtail C$ is also mono, so $gf\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{mono}}$.
	- Unitality and Associativity:
		As composition is the same as in $\mathcal{C}$, unitality of identities and associativity of composition holds.
- $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{epi}$:
	- Identities:
		By [[Identity is iso]] and [[Left-right inverse implies monic-epic]] $\operatorname{id}_A:A\twoheadrightarrow A$ is epi for all $A\in\operatorname{Obj}(\mathcal{C})$, so $\operatorname{id}_A\in \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{epi}}$.
	- Composition:
		By [[Composition of monics-epics is monic-epic]] if $A\overset{f}{\twoheadrightarrow}B\overset{g}{\twoheadrightarrow}C$ are epi in $\mathcal{C}$, then $gf:A \rightarrowtail C$ is also epi, so $gf\in\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{epi}}$.
	- Unitality and Associativity:
		As composition is the same as in $\mathcal{C}$, unitality of identities and associativity of composition holds.
- $\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{nonmono}$:
	$\mathcal{C}_\operatorname{nonmono}$ does not define a category as it would leave out identities.
