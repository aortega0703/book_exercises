Prove that there is only one possible multiplication table for $G$ if $G$ has exactly $1$, $2$, or $3$ elements. Analyse the possible multiplication tables for groups with exactly 4 elements, and show that there are two distinct tables, up to reordering the elements of $G$. Use these tables to prove that all groups with $\leq 4$ elements are commutative. (You are welcome to analyse groups with $5$ elements using the same technique, but you will soon know enough about groups to be able to avoid such brute-force approaches.)
##### Solution:
- $|G|=1$:
	The only multiplication in $G$ is $ee=e$. This leaves

| $\cdot$ | $e$ |
| ------- | --- |
| $e$     | $e$ |

- $|G|=2$: 
	All multiplications with $e$ are set, so the only choice left is for the value of $aa$. As $a$ needs an inverse, then necessarily $aa=e$. This leaves

| $\cdot$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| ------- | --- | --- |
| $e$     | $e$ | $a$ |
| $a$     | $a$ | $e$ |

- $|G|=3$:
	All multiplications with $e$ are set, so the only choices left are for the values of $aa$, $bb$, $ab$, and $ba$. If $ab=a$ then $b=e$ (which is a contradiction), similarly $ab=b\implies a=e$, so it must be the case that $ab=e$ (same with $ba=e$). The only multiplication left is $aa$ (and $bb$), so by [[Cancellation laws]] it must be different from the other entries in row and column $a$ (or $b$), then $aa=b$ ($bb=a$). This leaves

| $\cdot$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| $e$     | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |
| $a$     | $a$ | $b$ | $e$ |
| $b$     | $b$ | $e$ | $a$ |
- $|G|=4$, $aa=a$:
	Is not possible as that would imply $a=e$.
- $|G|=4$, $aa=b$ (or $c$):
	By [[Cancellation laws]] $ac=ca=e$ (as row/column $a$ already has $a,b$ and column/row $c$ already has $c$). This fixes $ab=ba=c$ (as row/column $a$ already has $a,b,e$). Then $bc=cb=a$ (as row/column $b$ already has $b,c$ and column/row $c$ already has $c,e$). The only spaces left are then $bb=e$ (as row $b$ already has $a$, $b$, $c$) and $cc=b$ (as row $b$ already has $a$, $c$, $e$) obtaining the table
					
| $\cdot$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $e$     | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| $a$     | $a$ | b   | $c$ | $e$ |
| $b$     | $b$ | $c$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| $c$     | $c$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ |

- $|G|=4$, $aa=bb=cc=e$:
	By [[Cancellation laws]] $ab=ba=c$ (as row/column $a$ already has $a$, $e$ and column/row $b$ already has $b$, $e$). This fixes $ac=ca=b$ (as row/column $a$ already has $a$, $c$, $e$). Then $ac=ca=b$ (as row/column $a$ already has $a$, $c$, $e$) and $bc=cb=a$ (as row/column $b$ already has $b$, $c$, $e$) obtaining the table 

| $\cdot$ | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $e$     | $e$ | $a$ | $b$ | $c$ |
| $a$     | $a$ | $e$ | $c$ | $b$ |
| $b$     | $b$ | $c$ | $e$ | $a$ |
| $c$     | $c$ | $b$ | $a$ | $e$ |
As the only groups of order $1,2,3$ and the only two groups of order $4$ are commutative, $|G|\leq 4$ implies $G$ is commutative.
