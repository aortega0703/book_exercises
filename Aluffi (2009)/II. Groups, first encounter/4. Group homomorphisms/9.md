Prove that if $m, n$ are positive integers such that $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, then $C_{mn} \cong C_m \times C_n$. [§4.3, 4.10, §IV.6.1, V.6.8]
##### Solution:
Let $\phi: C_{mn}\to C_m \times C_n$ defined by $[a]_{mn}\mapsto ([a]_m, [a]_n)$.
- $\phi$ is well-defined:
	Let $[a]_{mn}=[b]_{mn}$, so by [[Product of Modulus]] $[a]_m=[b]_m$ and $[a]_n=[b]_n$. Then
	$$
	\begin{align}
		\phi([a]_{mn})
		&= ([a]_m,[a]_n)\\
		&= ([b]_m,[b]_n)\\
		&= \phi([b]_{mn})
	\end{align}
	$$
	So $\phi$ is well-defined.
- $\phi$ is an homomorphism:
	By [[Mod Distributes Over Addition]]$$
	\begin{align}
		\phi([a]_{mn}+[b]_{mn})
		&= \phi([a+b]_{mn})\\
		&= ([a+b]_m,\ [a+b]_n)\\
		&= ([a]_m+[b]_m,\ [a]_n+[b]_n)\\
		&= ([a]_m, [a]_n) + ([b]_m, [b]_n)\\
		&= \phi([a]_{mn}) + \phi([b]_{mn})
	\end{align}
	$$
	So $\phi$ is an homomorphism.
- $\phi$ is mono:
	Let $[a]_{mn},[b]_{mn}$ such that $([a]_m,[a]_n)=\phi([a]_{mn})=\phi([b]_{mn})=([b]_m,[b]_n)$. Then $[a]_m = [b]_m$ and $[a]_n = [b]_n$, as $\gcd(m,n)=1$ by [[Product of Modulus]] $[a]_{mn}=[b]_{mn}$. So $\phi$ is mono.
- $\phi$ is iso:
	We know that $\text{Im}(\phi)\subseteq C_m\times C_n$. If $\text{Im} \subset C_m\times C_n$ then (as they are finite) we would have $|\text{Im}(\phi)|<|C_m\times C_n|$, but $|\text{Im}(\phi)|=|C_{mn}|=|C_m\times C_n|$ so this is a contradiction. This means that $\text{Im}(\phi)=C_m\times C_n$ making $\phi$ an isomorphism.
