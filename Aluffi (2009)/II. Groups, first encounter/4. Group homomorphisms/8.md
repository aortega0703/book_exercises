Let $G$ be a group, and let $g \in G$. Prove that the function $\gamma_g : G \to G$ defined by $\gamma_g(a) = gag^{−1}$ is an automorphism of $G$. (The automorphisms $\gamma_g$ are called ‘inner’ automorphisms of $G$.) Prove that the function $G \to \text{Aut}(G)$ defined by $g \mapsto \gamma_g$ is a homomorphism. Prove that this homomorphism is trivial if and only if $G$ is abelian. \[6.7, 7.11, IV.1.5\]
##### Solution:
- $\gamma_g$ is an automorphism:
	Consider the function$$
	\begin{align}
		\phi_g : G &\to G\\
		a &\mapsto g^{-1}ag
	\end{align}
	$$Then $(a)(\gamma_g\phi_g)=(gag^{-1})\phi_g=g^{-1}gag^{-1}g=a$, and $(a)(\phi_g\gamma_g)=(g^{-1}ag)\gamma_g=gg^{-1}agg^{-1}=a$, which by [[Set|Extensionality]] implies $\gamma_g\phi_g=\phi_g\gamma_g=\text{id}_G$ making $\gamma_g$ an automorphism.
- $\phi(g)=\gamma_g$ is an homomorphism:
	Let $a,b,c\in G$, then$$
	\begin{align}
		\gamma_{ab}(c)
		&= abc(ab)^{-1}\\
		&= abcb^{-1}c^{-1}\\
		&= \gamma_a(bcb^{-1})\\
		&= (\gamma_a\gamma_b)(c)
	\end{align}
	$$which by [[Set|Extensionality]] implies $\phi(ab)=\gamma_{ab}=\gamma_a\gamma_b=\phi(a)\phi(b)$.
- $\phi(g)$ is trivial $\iff G$ is abelian:
	- $\phi(g)$ is trivial $\implies G$ is abelian:
		Let $a,b\in G$, then by $\text{id}_G=\phi(b)=\gamma_b$$$
		\begin{align}
			ab &= \text{id}_G(a)b\\
			&= \gamma_b(a)b\\
			&= bab^{-1}b\\
			&= ba
		\end{align}
		$$
	- $G$ is abelian $\implies \phi(g)$ is trivial:
		Let $a\in G$, then$$
		\begin{align}
			\gamma_g(a) &= gag^{-1}\\
			&= gg^{-1}a\\
			&= a
		\end{align}
		$$which by [[Set|Extensionality]] implies $\phi(g)=\gamma_g=\text{id}_G$.
