- Compute the order of $[9]_{31}$ in the group $(\mathbb{Z}/31\mathbb{Z})^*$.
- Does the equation $x^3 âˆ’ 9 = 0$ have solutions in $\mathbb{Z}/31\mathbb{Z}$? (Hint: Plugging in all 31 elements of $\mathbb{Z}/31\mathbb{Z}$ is too laborious and will not teach you much. Instead, use the result of the first part: if $c$ is a solution of the equation, what can you say about $|c|$?) \[VII.5.15\]
##### Solution:
- $|9|=15$ in $G=(\mathbb{Z}/31\mathbb{Z})^*$:
	By [[Aluffi (2009)/II. Groups, first encounter/4. Group homomorphisms/11|11]] $G$ is cyclic, therefore generated by a single element $g$ and by [[Element of max order iff integers mod n]] $|g|=|G|$. Then by [[Maximal order element is multiple of all orders]] $|9|$ divides $|G|=30$, so $|9|\in\{1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30\}$.	
	- $9^2=81\cong_{31} 19$
	- $9^3=9^2*9\cong_{31} 19*9=171\cong_{31} 16$
	- $9^5 = 9^3*9^2 \cong_{31} 16*19= 304\cong_{31} 25$
	- $9^6 = 9^5* 9\cong_{31} 25*9=225\cong_{31}8$
	- $9^{10}=(9^5)^2\cong_{31} 25^2 = 625 \cong_{31} 5$
	- $9^{15} = 9^{10}* 9^5 \cong_{31} 5*25=125\cong_{31}1$
	Then $|9| = 15$.
- Does $x^3-9=0$ have solutions in $G=\mathbb{Z}/31\mathbb{Z}$:
	Suppose $c$ such that $c^3\cong 9\ (\text{mod }31)$, by [[Order of power element]]$$
	\begin{align}
		\frac{|c|}{\gcd(|c|,3)} &= |c^3| = |9| = 15\\
		|c| &= 15\gcd(|c|,3)
	\end{align}
	$$As $|c|\leq |G|=30$ and is a multiple of $15$, we can only have $|c|\in\{15,30\}$, however for both values $\gcd(|c|,3)=3$ which makes $|c|=15*3=45>30=|G|$ which is a contradiction. Therefore $x^3-9\cong 0\ (\text{mod } 31)$ has no solutions.
