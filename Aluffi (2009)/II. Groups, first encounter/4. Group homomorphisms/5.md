Prove that the groups $(\mathbb{R} -\{0\}, \cdot)$ and $(\mathbb{C} - \{0\}, \cdot)$ are not isomorphic.
##### Solution:
$i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, $i^4=1$, therefore $|i|=4$. Let  $r\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $r^4=1$, then $r=1$ or $r=-1$, however $|1|=1$ and $|-1|=2$, so by [[Group isomorphism preserves order]] there cannot be an isomorphism between both groups as there are no elements of order $4$ in $\mathbb{R}$.
