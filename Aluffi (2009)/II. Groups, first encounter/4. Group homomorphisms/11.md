In due time we will prove the easy fact that if $p$ is a prime integer, then the equation $x^d = 1$ can have at most $d$ solutions in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Assume this fact, and prove that the multiplicative group $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*$ is cyclic. (Hint: Let $g \in G$ be an element of maximal order; use Exercise 1.15 to show that $h^{|g|} = 1$ for all $h \in G$. Therefore...) \[§4.3, 4.15, 4.16, §IV.6.3\]
##### Solution:
By [[Maximal order element is multiple of all orders]] for every $h\in G$ there is some $k$ such that $|g|=k|h|$, so by [[Order divides exponent]] $h^{|g|}=h^{k|h|}=e$. Then $x^{|g|}=e$ has $|G|$ solutions (every possible $h$), but we assumed that it can have at most $|g|$ solutions, giving $|G|\leq |g|$, but $|g|\leq |G|$ so $|G|=|g|$. By [[Element of max order iff integers mod n]] then $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^*\cong \mathbb{Z}/(p-1)\mathbb{Z}$, so it is cyclic by definition.
