Show that the homomorphism $\pi^4_2 \times \pi^4_2 : C_4 \to C_2 \times C_2$ is not an isomorphism. In fact, is there any isomorphism $C_4 \to C_2 \times C_2$?
##### Solution:
The orders of the elements of $C_4$ are

| $c$ | $\vert c\vert$ |
| --- | -------------- |
| $0$ | $1$            |
| $1$ | $4$            |
| $2$ | $2$            |
| $3$ | $4$            |
The order of elements of $C_2\times C_2$ are

| $c$     | $\vert c\vert$ |
| ------- | -------------- |
| $(0,0)$ | $1$            |
| $(0,1)$ | $2$            |
| $(1,0)$ | $2$            |
| $(1,1)$ | $2$            |
So by [[Group isomorphism preserves order]] there can be no isomorphism between the groups.
